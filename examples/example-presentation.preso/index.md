# Agenda

Today, we'll cover three topics:

1. Bears
2. Monkeys
3. Ocelots

I *think* you'll really enjoy this presentation.

# Bears

They hate bees.

## Bears Are Big

They are *big* and make nice rugs.

--

## Bears Are Brown

That's right, they're totally brown!

==

# Monkeys

--

## Monkey Notes

* Monkeys are funny
* Especially in hats
* But, they fling poop.

--

## Never Trust a Monkey

A wise man once said:

> Never trust a monkey. Their butts are hairless!

That man was my father.

# Ocelots

They're boring, so this is it.
